# Finger Count Recognition

This repository contains a Python project for finger count recognition using OpenCV.

## Introduction

**Finger Count Recognition** is a computer vision project that uses OpenCV to detect and count the number of fingers shown in front of a camera.  
This can be useful in various applications such as gesture control, sign language recognition, and interactive systems.

## Features

- **Real-time finger count recognition**
- **Simple and efficient algorithm using OpenCV**
- **Easy to set up and run**

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/finger-count-recognition.git
    cd finger-count-recognition
    ```

## Usage

To run the finger count recognition script, use the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python recognize.py
 ```
