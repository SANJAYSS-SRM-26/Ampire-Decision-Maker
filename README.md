# Finger-Count-Recognition

This repository contains a Python project for finger count recognition using OpenCV. 

## Introduction

Finger Count Recognition is a computer vision project that uses OpenCV to detect and count the number of fingers shown in front of a camera. <br>
This can be useful in various applications such as gesture control, sign language recognition, and interactive systems.

## Features

Real-time finger count recognition <br>
Simple and efficient algorithm using OpenCV <br>
Easy to set up and run

## Usage

To run the finger count recognition script, use the following command in your terminal: <br>
## python recognize.py <br>
The script will activate your camera and start recognizing and counting the number of fingers shown in front of it.
